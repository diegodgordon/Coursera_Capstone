    "Big cities, like Toronto, have a higher chance to possess a saturated market in many neighborhoods, making it more difficult for new businesses to be thrive. It is key for new businesses' success to have a good balance in between demand and supply within the location they start. High demand guarantees that there is a need for the product/service, and low supply guarantees that there's not enough business in the area to satisfy customers' needs. The goal was to find geographical locations of low supply for a specific product/service, therefore offering the least amount of competition to new businesses. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the idea of a new restaurant/coffee shop opening up in the city of Toronto was used. Then, the top 10 neighborhoods with the highest and lowest supply of restaurants/coffee shops were calculated; therefore, areas to avoid and to consider were found. While this approach doesn't guarantee new businesses' success, it offers a range possibilities for areas of little competition. It is recommended to complement this service with additional market analysis to identify regions of high demand for the product/service offered. "
